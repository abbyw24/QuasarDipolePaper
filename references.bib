	abstract = {We present a new approach to constructing and fitting dipoles and higher-order multipoles in synthetic galaxy samples over the sky. Within our Bayesian paradigm, we illustrate that this technique is robust to masked skies, allowing us to make credible inferences about the relative contributions of each multipole. We also show that dipoles can be recovered in surveys with small footprints, determining the requisite source counts required for concrete estimation of the dipole parameters. This work is motivated by recent probes of the cosmic dipole in galaxy catalogues. Namely, the kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background, as arising from the motion of our heliocentric frame at \${\textbackslash}approx 370{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}text\{km\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, implies that an analogous dipole should be observed in the number counts of galaxies in flux-density-limited samples. Recent studies have reported a dipole aligning with the kinematic dipole but with an anomalously large amplitude. Accordingly, our new technique will be important as forthcoming galaxy surveys are made available and for revisiting previous data.},

	abstract = {Measurements of the number count dipole with large surveys have shown amplitudes in tension with kinematic predictions based on the observed Doppler dipole of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These observations seem to be in direct conflict with a homogeneous and isotropic Universe as asserted by the cosmological principle, demanding further investigation into the origin of the tension. Here, we investigate whether the observed number count dipoles are consistent with being fully kinematic or if there is any residual anisotropy contributing to the total observed dipole. To disentangle these contributions, we aim to leverage the fact that the kinematic matter dipole expected in a given galaxy catalogue scales with observed properties of the sample, and different catalogues used in the literature therefore have different kinematic dipole expectations. We here perform joint dipole fits using the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), and the AGN catalogue derived from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (CatWISE). Assuming a common kinematic and non-kinematic dipole component between all catalogues, we find that a large residual, non-kinematic dipole anisotropy is detected, though a common direction between the two components is disfavoured by model selection. Freeing up both amplitude and direction for this residual dipole while fixing the kinematic dipole to the CMB dipole expectation, we recover a significant residual dipole with \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{D\}\_\{resid\} = (0.81{\textbackslash}pm0.14){\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$, that is offset from the CMB dipole direction by \$39{\textbackslash}pm8\$ degrees. While the present work provides a valuable first test of this concept, its scrutinising power is limited by the currently employed catalogues. Larger catalogues, especially in radio, will be needed to further lift the degeneracy between the kinematic and residual dipole components.},

	abstract = {We investigate claims of an anomalously large amplitude of the dipole in the distribution of quasars on the sky. Two main issues indicate that the systematic uncertainties in the derived quasar-density dipole are underestimated. Firstly, the spatial distribution of the quasars is not a pure dipole, possessing low-order multipoles of comparable size to the dipole. These multipoles are unexpected and presumably caused by unknown systematic effects; we cannot be confident that the dipole amplitude is not also affected by the same systematics until the origin of these fluctuations is understood. Secondly, the 50 percent sky cut associated with the quasar catalogue strongly couples the multipoles, meaning that the power estimate at ell=1 contains significant contributions from ell{\textgreater}1. In particular, the dominant quadrupole mode in the Galactic mask strongly couples the dipole with the octupole, leading to a large uncertainty in the dipole amplitude. Together these issues mean that the dipole in the quasar catalogue has an uncertainty large enough that consistency with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole cannot be ruled out. More generally, current data sets are insufficiently clean to robustly measure the quasar dipole and future studies will require samples that are larger (preferably covering more of the sky) and free of systematic effects to make strong claims regarding their consistency with the CMB dipole.},

There currently exist many observations which indicate a departure from this principle. It has been shown that many of these observations can be explained by invoking superhorizon cosmological perturbations and may be consistent with the Big Bang paradigm. Remarkably, these modes simultaneously explain the observed Hubble tension, i.e., the discrepancy between the direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble parameter. We propose several tests of the cosmological principle using SKA. In particular, we can reliably extract the signal of dipole anisotropy in the distribution of radio galaxies. The superhorizon perturbations also predict a significant redshift dependence of the dipole signal which can be nicely tested by the study of signals of reionization and the dark ages using SKA. We also propose to study the alignment of radio galaxy axes as well as their integrated polarization vectors over distance scales ranging from a few Mpc to Gpc. We discuss data analysis techniques that can reliably extract these signals from data.},

	abstract = {Recent measurements using catalogues of quasars and radio galaxies have shown that the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is about twice as large as is expected in the standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model, indeed in any cosmology based on the Friedman-Lema{\textbackslash}{\textasciicircum}itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. This expectation is based on the kinematic interpretation of the dipole anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background, i.e. as arising due to our local peculiar velocity. The effect of aberration and Doppler boosting on the projected number counts on the sky of cosmologically distant objects in a flux-limited catalogue can then be calculated and confronted with observations. This fundamental consistency test of FLRW models proposed by Ellis \& Baldwin (1984) was revisited by Dalang \& Bonvin (2022) [arXiv:2111.03616] who argued that redshift evolution of the sources can significantly affect the expected matter dipole. In this note we demonstrate that the Ellis \& Baldwin test is in fact robust to such effects, hence the {\textgreater} 5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ dipole anomaly uncovered by Secrest et al. (2021, 2022) [arXiv:2009.14826, arXiv:2206.05624] remains an outstanding challenge to the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM model.},

Two of them, the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS), have recently yielded dipoles that appear incongruent with each other as well as seem inconsistent with previous radio survey dipoles and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole. Because these radio surveys have large overlaps in sky coverage, comprising hence large majority of common radio sources, one would not expect significant differences between their radio dipoles, irrespective of their underlying source of origin. We examine here in detail these radio dipoles, to ascertain the source of incongruency among them. We find the VLASS and RACS data to be containing some declination-dependent systematics, seemingly in the vicinity of the declination limit of each survey. We show that the effects of such systematics can be mitigated by restricting the declination limits of the respective survey during the dipole determination. A weighted mean of the sky coordinates of thus derived dipoles from the four radio surveys lies within 1.2σ of the CMB dipole direction. However, the amplitude appears significantly larger, 3.7 ± 0.6 times or more than the CMB dipole. This puts in doubt not only the conventional wisdom that the genesis of all these dipoles, including that of the CMB dipole, is due to the Solar peculiar motion, it also raises uncomfortable questions about the Cosmological Principle, the basis of the standard ΛCDM cosmological model.},

However, a recent Bayesian analysis of the QUAIA sample, comprising 1.3 million quasars, has yielded a dipole that seems to be in tandem with the CMB dipole, in contravention of most previous studies of AGN dipoles. Since the question has large cosmological implications, we investigate the QUAIA quasar sample afresh, by directly computing the dipole from asymmetries observed in the source number counts. We instead find a dipole 3-4 times as large as the CMB dipole though in the same direction. Further, it has been claimed elsewhere that the difference between the CMB dipole and the radio dipole estimated from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS), the first large catalogue that showed an AGN dipole about four times larger than the CMB dipole, can be fully accounted for by incorporating the shot-noise and clustering contributions to the total NVSS dipole. A careful reinvestigation of the NVSS dipole, however, shows that the random phenomena like shot noise or clustering cannot account for the actually observed NVSS asymmetries, which show a systematic dipole pattern over the sky.},

	abstract = {In recent years, large radio surveys of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), comprising millions of sources, have become available where one could investigate dipole asymmetries, assumedly arising due to a peculiar motion of the Solar system. Investigations of such dipoles have yielded in past much larger amplitudes than the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, though their directions seem to lie close to the CMB dipole. Here we investigate dipole asymmetries in two recent large radio surveys, Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) containing 1.9 million sources, covering the sky north of \$-40{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ declination, and the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) containing 2.1 million sources, covering the sky south of \$+30{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$ declination. We find dipoles determined from the VLASS and RACS surveys to be significantly larger than the CMB dipole. Dipole directions from the VLASS and RACS data differ significantly from each other. Nevertheless, along with a number of other previously determined dipoles, including the CMB, they all appear to lie in a narrow sky region, which argues for the various dipoles to be related somehow. However, significant differences in their derived peculiar velocities, including that of the CMB, cannot be explained by a peculiar motion of the Solar system, which should necessarily be a single value. Instead, their discordant peculiar velocities may be indicating that different cosmic reference frames are moving relative to each other or that the matter distribution on cosmic scales is not homogeneous and isotropic, either scenario being in contravention of what expected from the Cosmological Principle (CP).},

	abstract = {The peculiar motion of the Earth causes a dipole anisotropy modulation in the distant galaxy distribution due to the aberration effect. However, the amplitude and angular direction of the effect is not necessarily the same as those of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole anisotropy due to the growth of cosmic structures. In other words exploring the aberration effect may give us a clue to the horizon-scale physics perhaps related to the cosmic acceleration. In this paper we develop a method to explore the dipole angular modulation from the pixelized galaxy data on the sky properly taking into account the covariances due to the shot noise and the intrinsic galaxy clustering contamination as well as the partial sky coverage. We applied the method to the galaxy catalogs constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 6 data. After constructing the four galaxy catalogs that are different in the ranges of magnitudes and photometric redshifts to study possible systematics, we found that the most robust sample against systematics indicates no dipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution. This finding is consistent with the expectation from the concordance Lambda-dominated cold dark matter model. Finally we argue that an almost full-sky galaxy survey such as LSST may allow for a significant detection of the aberration effect of the CMB dipole having the precision of constraining the angular direction to {\textasciitilde} 20 degrees in radius. Assuming a hypothetical LSST galaxy survey, we find that this method can confirm or reject the result implied from a stacked analysis of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect of X-ray luminous clusters in Kashlinsky et al. (2008,2009) if the implied cosmic bulk flow is not extended out to the horizon.},

In addition to this signal generated by Doppler boosting of the CMB monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the CMB temperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation at cosmological distances).

Nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, high angular resolution, and low noise levels of the Planck satellite.

Additionally, the dipole modulates the CMB temperature anisotropies with the same frequency dependence as the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect and so these modulated CMB anisotropies can be extracted from the tSZ maps produced by Planck. Unfortunately, this measurement cannot determine if the dipole is due to our motion, but it does provide an independent measure of the dipole and a validation of the y maps. This measurement, and a description of the first-order terms of the CMB dipole, are outlined here.},

	abstract = {We present the first joint analysis of catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars to determine whether their sky distribution is consistent with the standard ΛCDM model of cosmology. This model is based on the cosmological principle, which asserts that the universe is statistically isotropic and homogeneous on large scales, so the observed dipole anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) must be attributed to our local peculiar motion. We test the null hypothesis that there is a dipole anisotropy in the sky distribution of radio galaxies and quasars consistent with the motion inferred from the CMB, as is expected for cosmologically distant sources. Our two samples, constructed respectively from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, are systematically independent and have no shared objects. Using a completely general statistic that accounts for correlation between the found dipole amplitude and its directional offset from the CMB dipole, the null hypothesis is independently rejected by the radio galaxy and quasar samples with p-values of 8.9 × 10−3 and 1.2 × 10−5, respectively, corresponding to 2.6σ and 4.4σ significance. The joint significance, using sample-size-weighted Z-scores, is 5.1σ. We show that the radio galaxy and quasar dipoles are consistent with each other and find no evidence for any frequency dependence of the amplitude. The consistency of the two dipoles improves if we boost to the CMB frame assuming its dipole to be fully kinematic, suggesting that cosmologically distant radio galaxies and quasars may have an intrinsic anisotropy in this frame.},

	abstract = {Verifying the fully kinematic nature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole is of fundamental importance in cosmology. In the standard cosmological model with the Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric from the inflationary expansion the CMB dipole should be entirely kinematic. Any non-kinematic CMB dipole component would thus reflect the preinflationary structure of spacetime probing the extent of the FLRW applicability. Cosmic backgrounds from galaxies after the matter-radiation decoupling, should have kinematic dipole component identical in velocity with the CMB kinematic dipole. Comparing the two can lead to isolating the CMB non-kinematic dipole. It was recently proposed that such measurement can be done using the near-IR cosmic infrared background (CIB) measured with the currently operating Euclid telescope, and later with Roman. The proposed method reconstructs the resolved CIB, the Integrated Galaxy Light (IGL), from Euclid's Wide Survey and probes its dipole, with a kinematic component amplified over that of the CMB by the Compton-Getting effect. The amplification coupled with the extensive galaxy samples forming the IGL would determine the CIB dipole with an overwhelming signal/noise, isolating its direction to sub-degree accuracy. We develop details of the method for Euclid's Wide Survey in 4 bands spanning 0.6 to 2 mic. We isolate the systematic and other uncertainties and present methodologies to minimize them, after confining the sample to the magnitude range with negligible IGL/CIB dipole from galaxy clustering. These include the required star-galaxy separation, accounting for the extinction correction dipole using the method newly developed here achieving total separation, accounting for the Earth's orbital motion and other systematic effects.

We determine the dipole anisotropy in the number counts of two all-sky surveys of radio galaxies. For the first time, this analysis is presented for the TGSS survey, allowing us to check consistency of the radio dipole at low and high frequencies by comparing the results with the well-known NVSS survey. We match the flux thresholds of the catalogues, with flux limits chosen to minimise systematics, and adopt a strict masking scheme. We find dipole directions that are in good agreement with each other and with the CMB dipole. In order to compare the amplitude of the dipoles with theoretical predictions, we produce sets of lognormal realisations. Our realisations include the theoretical kinematic dipole, galaxy clustering, Poisson noise, simulated redshift distributions which fit the NVSS and TGSS source counts, and errors in flux calibration. The measured dipole for NVSS is ∼2 times larger than predicted by the mock data. For TGSS, the dipole is almost ∼ 5 times larger than predicted, even after checking for completeness and taking account of errors in source fluxes and in flux calibration. Further work is required to understand the nature of the systematics that are the likely cause of the anomalously large TGSS dipole amplitude.},

We take into account both aberration and Doppler boost to deduce our velocity from the hemispherical number count asymmetry, as well as via a 3-dimensional linear estimator. Both the magnitude and direction depend on cuts made to the catalogue, e.g. on the lowest source flux, however these effects are small. With the hemispheric number count asymmetry method we obtain a velocity of 1729 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 187 km/s i.e. about 4 times larger than that obtained from the CMB dipole, but close in direction, towards RA=149 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2 degree, DEC = -17 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 12 degree.

The amplitude of the model signal depends on the bias factor b of the NVSS mock galaxies. For sources with flux density, S {\textgreater} 15 mJy, the bias recipe inferred from higher order moments is consistent with the observed dipole signal at 2.12σ.

The dipole anisotropy is expected due to our local motion with respect to the CMBR rest frame. We analyse data with an improved fit to the number density, n(S), as a function of the flux density S, which allows deviation from a pure power law behaviour. We also impose more stringent cuts to remove the contribution due to clustering dipole. In agreement with earlier results, we find that the amplitude of anisotropy is significantly larger in comparison to the prediction based on CMBR measurements. The extracted speed is found to be roughly 3 times the speed corresponding to CMBR. The significance of deviation is smaller, roughly 2σ, in comparison to earlier estimates. For the cut, S{\textgreater}30mJy, the speed is found to be 1110±370km/s using the source count analysis. The direction of the dipole anisotropy is found to be approximately in agreement with CMBR. We find that the results are relatively insensitive to the lower as well as upper limit imposed on the flux density. Our results suggest that the Universe is intrinsically anisotropic with the axis of anisotropy pointing roughly towards the CMBR dipole direction. Finally we present a method which may allow an independent extraction of the local speed and an intrinsic dipole anisotropy, provided a larger data set becomes available in future.},

To quadratic order in the dipole amplitude, there is an intensity quadrupole induced by the dipole with a frequency dependence given by the second derivative of the Planck function. The Planck satellite should be able to detect this dipole-induced intensity quadrupole and distinguish it through its frequency depdendence from the intrinsic CMB temperature and foreground quadrupoles.

This motion is evidenced by the systematic temperature shift - or dipole anisotropy - observed in the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation (CMB). Because of the Doppler effect, the temperature of the CMB is 0.1 per cent higher in our direction of motion through the Universe. If our standard cosmological understanding is correct, this dipole should also be present as an enhancement in the surface density of distant galaxies. The main obstacle in finding this signal is the very uneven distribution of nearby galaxies in the Local Supercluster, which drowns out the small cosmological imprint. Here we report the first detection of the expected dipole anisotropy in the galaxy distribution, in a survey of galaxies detected in radio waves. Radio galaxies are mostly located at cosmological distances, so the contamination from nearby clusters should be small. With local radio sources removed, we find a dipole anisotropy in the radio galaxy distribution in the same direction as the CMB, close to the expected amplitude. This result is confirmation of the standard cosmological interpretation of the CMB.},

With it, we derive cosmology constraints from the amplitude and growth of structure across cosmic time. We divide the sample into two redshift bins, centered at \$z=1.0\$ and \$z=2.1\$, and measure both overdensity auto-correlations and cross-correlations with maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background convergence measured by Planck. From these data, and including a prior from measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations scale, we place constraints on the amplitude of the matter power spectrum \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8=0.766{\textbackslash}pm 0.034\$, and on the matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m=0.343{\textasciicircum}\{+0.017\}\_\{-0.019\}\$. These measurements are in reasonable agreement with {\textbackslash}planck at the \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 1.4\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level, and are found to be robust with respect to observational and theoretical uncertainties. We find that our slightly lower value of \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$ is driven by the higher-redshift sample, which favours a low amplitude of matter fluctuations. We present plausible arguments showing that this could be driven by contamination of the CMB lensing map by high-redshift extragalactic foregrounds, which should also affect other cross-correlations with tracers of large-scale structure beyond \$z{\textbackslash}sim1.5\$. Our constraints are competitive with those from state-of-the-art 3\${\textbackslash}times\$2-point analyses, but arise from a range of scales and redshifts that is highly complementary to those covered by cosmic shear data and most galaxy clustering samples. This, coupled with the unprecedented combination of volume and redshift precision achieved by Quaia allows us to break the usual degeneracy between \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8\$.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an all-sky model of dust emission from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 353, 545, and 857 GHz, and IRAS 100 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m data. Using a modified blackbody fit to the data we present all-sky maps of the dust optical depth, temperature, and spectral index over the 353–3000 GHz range. This model is a good representation of the IRAS and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data at 5′ between 353 and 3000 GHz (850 and 100 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}m). It shows variations of the order of 30\% compared with the widely-used model of Finkbeiner, Davis, and Schlegel. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} data allow us to estimate the dust temperature uniformly over the whole sky, down to an angular resolution of 5′, providing an improved estimate of the dust optical depth compared to previous all-sky dust model, especially in high-contrast molecular regions where the dust temperature varies strongly at small scales in response to dust evolution, extinction, and/or local production of heating photons. An increase of the dust opacity at 353 GHz, {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}353{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, from the diffuse to the denser interstellar medium (ISM) is reported. It is associated with a decrease in the observed dust temperature, {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}obs{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, that could be due at least in part to the increased dust opacity. We also report an excess of dust emission at H i column densities lower than 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}20{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} that could be the signature of dust in the warm ionized medium. In the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitude, we report an anticorrelation between {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}353{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}H{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}obs{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} while the dust specific luminosity, i.e., the total dust emission integrated over frequency (the radiance) per hydrogen atom, stays about constant, confirming one of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Early Results obtained on selected fields. This effect is compatible with the view that, in the diffuse ISM, {\textless}i{\textgreater}T{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}obs{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} responds to spatial variations of the dust opacity, due to variations of dust properties, in addition to (small) variations of the radiation field strength. The implication is that in the diffuse high-latitude ISM {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}353{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} is not as reliable a tracer of dust column density as we conclude it is in molecular clouds where the correlation of {\textless}i{\textgreater}τ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}353{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} with dust extinction estimated using colour excess measurements on stars is strong. To estimate Galactic {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater} − {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) in extragalactic fields at high latitude we develop a new method based on the thermal dust radiance, instead of the dust optical depth, calibrated to {\textless}i{\textgreater}E{\textless}i/{\textgreater}({\textless}i{\textgreater}B{\textless}i/{\textgreater} − {\textless}i{\textgreater}V{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) using reddening measurements of quasars deduced from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data.},

	abstract = {We present a Bayesian analysis of the Quaia sample of 1.3 million quasars as a test of the cosmological principle. This principle postulates that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, forming the basis of prevailing cosmological models. However, recent analyses of quasar samples have found a matter dipole inconsistent with the inferred kinematic dipole of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), representing a tension with the expectations of the cosmological principle. Here, we explore various hypotheses for the distribution of quasars in Quaia, finding that the sample is influenced by selection effects with significant contamination near the galactic plane. After excising these regions, we find significant evidence that the Quaia quasar dipole is consistent with the CMB dipole, both in terms of the expected amplitude and direction. This result is in conflict with recent analyses, lending support to the cosmological principle and the interpretation that the observed dipole is due to our local departure from the Hubble flow.},

	abstract = {Many recent analyses have indicated that large scale WMAP data display anomalies that appear inconsistent with the standard cosmological paradigm. However, the effects of foreground contamination, which require elimination of some fraction of the data, have not been carefully investigated due to the complexity in the analysis. Here we develop a general formalism of how to incorporate these effects in any analysis of this type. Our approach is to compute the full multi-dimensional probability distribution function of all possible sky realizations that are consistent with the data and with the allowed level of contamination. As an example we apply this method to compute the joint probability distribution function for the possible realizations of quadrupole and octopole using the WMAP data. This 12 dimensional distribution function is explored using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The resulting chains are used to asses the statistical significance of the low quadrupole using frequentist methods, the quadrupole-octopole alignment using several methods (angular momentum dispersion, multipole vectors and a new method based of feature matching) and the quadrupole-octopole aligment with ecliptic.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.07256v1},
	abstract = {There are many uses for linear fitting; the context here is interpolation and denoising of data, as when you have calibration data and you want to fit a smooth, flexible function to those data. Or you want to fit a flexible function to de-trend a time series or normalize a spectrum. In these contexts, investigators often choose a polynomial basis, or a Fourier basis, or wavelets, or something equally general. They also choose an order, or number of basis functions to fit, and (often) some kind of regularization. We discuss how this basis-function fitting is done, with ordinary least squares and extensions thereof. We emphasize that it is often valuable to choose far more parameters than data points, despite folk rules to the contrary: Suitably regularized models with enormous numbers of parameters generalize well and make good predictions for held-out data; over-fitting is not (mainly) a problem of having too many parameters. It is even possible to take the limit of infinite parameters, at which, if the basis and regularization are chosen correctly, the least-squares fit becomes the mean of a Gaussian process. We recommend cross-validation as a good empirical method for model selection (for example, setting the number of parameters and the form of the regularization), and jackknife resampling as a good empirical method for estimating the uncertainties of the predictions made by the model. We also give advice for building stable computational implementations.},

	abstract = {The European Space Agency's Planck satellite, which was dedicated to studying the early Universe and its subsequent evolution, was launched on 14 May 2009. It scanned the microwave and submillimetre sky continuously between 12 August 2009 and 23 October 2013, producing deep, high-resolution, all-sky maps in nine frequency bands from 30 to 857 GHz. This paper presents the cosmological legacy of Planck, which currently provides our strongest constraints on the parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of the tightest limits available on deviations from that model. The 6-parameter ΛCDM model continues to provide an excellent fit to the cosmic microwave background data at high and low redshift, describing the cosmological information in over a billion map pixels with just six parameters. With 18 peaks in the temperature and polarization angular power spectra constrained well, Planck measures five of the six parameters to better than 1\% (simultaneously), with the best-determined parameter (θ*) now known to 0.03\%. We describe the multi-component sky as seen by Planck, the success of the ΛCDM model, and the connection to lower-redshift probes of structure formation. We also give a comprehensive summary of the major changes introduced in this 2018 release. The Planck data, alone and in combination with other probes, provide stringent constraints on our models of the early Universe and the large-scale structure within which all astrophysical objects form and evolve. We discuss some lessons learned from the Planck mission, and highlight areas ripe for further experimental advances.},

The first observations began in 2017 September, and observing for the survey will finish in 2024. VLASS will use approximately 5500 hr of time on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to cover the whole sky visible to the VLA (decl. {\textgreater} -40°), a total of 33 885 deg 2 . The data will be taken in three epochs to allow the discovery of variable and transient radio sources. The survey is designed to engage radio astronomy experts, multi-wavelength astronomers, and citizen scientists alike. By utilizing an "on the fly" interferometry mode, the observing overheads are much reduced compared to a conventional pointed survey. In this paper, we present the science case and observational strategy for the survey, and also results from early survey observations.},

	abstract = {An observer moving with respect to the cosmic rest frame should observe a concentration and brightening of galaxies in the direction of motion and a spreading and dimming in the opposite direction. The velocity inferred from this dipole should match that of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature dipole if galaxies are on average at rest with respect to the CMB rest frame. However, recent studies have claimed a many-fold enhancement of galaxy counts and flux in the direction of the solar motion compared to the CMB expectation, calling into question the standard cosmology. Here we show that the sky distribution and brightness of extragalactic radio sources are consistent with the CMB dipole in direction and velocity. We use the first epoch of the Very Large Array Sky Survey combined with the Rapid Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder Continuum Survey to estimate the dipole via several different methods, and all show similar results. Typical fits find a km s−1 velocity dipole with apex in Galactic coordinates from source counts and km s−1 toward from radio fluxes. These are consistent with the CMB-solar velocity, 370 km s−1 toward (ℓ, b) = (264, 48), and show that galaxies are on average at rest with respect to the rest frame of the early universe, as predicted by the canonical cosmology.},

	abstract = {According to the cosmological principle, the Universe should appear isotropic, without any preferred directions, to an observer whom we may consider to be fixed in the co-moving co-ordinate system of the expanding Universe. Such an observer is stationary with respect to the average distribution of the matter in the Universe and the sky brightness at any frequency should appear uniform in all directions to such an observer. However a peculiar motion of such an observer, due to a combined effect of Doppler boosting and aberration, will introduce a dipole anisotropy in the observed sky brightness; in reverse an observed dipole anisotropy in the sky brightness could be used to infer the peculiar velocity of the observer with respect to the average Universe. We determine the peculiar velocity of the solar system relative to the frame of distant radio sources, by studying the anisotropy in the sky brightness from discrete radio sources, i.e., an integrated emission from discrete sources per unit solid angle. Our results give a direction of the velocity vector in agreement with the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR) value, but the magnitude (\${\textbackslash}sim 1600{\textbackslash}pm 400\$ km/s) is \${\textbackslash}sim 4\$ times the CMBR value (\$369{\textbackslash}pm 1\$ km/s) at a statistically significant (\${\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash}sigma\$) level. A genuine difference between the two dipoles would imply anisotropic Universe, with the anisotropy changing with the epoch. This would violate the cosmological principle where the isotropy of the Universe is assumed for all epochs, and on which the whole modern cosmology is based upon.},

This dataset adds two years to that used for the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog (Eisenhardt et al., 2020), bringing the total to six times as many exposures spanning over sixteen times as large a time baseline as the AllWISE catalog. The other major change from the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog is that the detection list for the CatWISE2020 Catalog was generated using \$\{{\textbackslash}it crowdsource\}\$ (Schlafly et al. 2019), while the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog used the detection software used for AllWISE. These two factors result in roughly twice as many sources in the CatWISE2020 Catalog. The scatter with respect to \$\{{\textbackslash}it Spitzer\}\$ photometry at faint magnitudes in the COSMOS field, which is out of the Galactic plane and at low ecliptic latitude (corresponding to lower WISE coverage depth) is similar to that for the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog. The 90\% completeness depth for the CatWISE2020 Catalog is at W1=17.7 mag and W2=17.5 mag, 1.7 mag deeper than in the CatWISE Preliminary Catalog.

The catalog draws on the 6,649,162 quasar candidates identified by the Gaia mission that have redshift estimates from the space observatory's low-resolution BP/RP spectra. This initial sample is highly homogeneous and complete, but has low purity, and 18\% of even the bright (\$G{\textless}20.0\$) confirmed quasars have discrepant redshift estimates (\${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Delta z/(1+z){\textbar} {\textgreater} 0.2\$) compared to those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work, we combine the Gaia candidates with unWISE infrared data (based on the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer survey) to construct a catalog useful for cosmological and astrophysical quasar studies. We apply cuts based on proper motions and Gaia and unWISE colors, reducing the number of contaminants by \${\textbackslash}sim\$4\${\textbackslash}times\$. We improve the redshifts by training a \$k\$-nearest neighbors model on colors and Gaia redshift estimates and using SDSS redshift labels, and achieve redshift estimates on the \$G{\textless}20.0\$ sample with only 6\% (10\%) catastrophic errors with \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}Delta z/(1+z){\textbar} {\textgreater} 0.2\$ (\$0.1\$), a reduction of \${\textbackslash}sim\$3\${\textbackslash}times\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2\${\textbackslash}times\$) compared to the Gaia redshifts. The final catalog has 1,295,502 quasars with a \$G{\textless}20.5\$, and 755,850 candidates in an even cleaner \$G{\textless}20.0\$ sample. We also construct a rigorous all-sky selection function model for the catalog. We compare Quaia to existing quasar catalogs, in particular showing that its large effective volume makes it a highly competitive sample for cosmological large-scale structure analyses.

	abstract = {Extragalactic astronomy relies on the accurate estimation of source photometry corrected for Milky Way dust extinction. This has motivated the creation of a number of “Galactic” dust maps. We investigate whether these maps are contaminated by extragalactic signals using the clustering-redshift technique, i.e., by measuring a set of angular cross-correlations with spectroscopic objects as a function of redshift. Our tomographic analysis reveals imprints of extragalactic large-scale structure patterns in nine out of 10 Galactic dust maps, including all infrared-based maps as well as “stellar” reddening maps. When such maps are used for extinction corrections, this extragalactic contamination introduces redshift- and scale-dependent biases in photometric estimates at the millimagnitude level. It can affect both object-based analyses, such as the estimation of the Hubble diagram with supernovae, as well as spatial statistics. The bias can be appreciable when measuring angular correlation functions with low amplitudes, such as lensing-induced correlations or angular correlations for sources distributed over a broad redshift range. As expected, we do not detect any extragalactic contamination for the dust map inferred from 21 cm H I observations. Such a map provides an alternative to widely used infrared-based maps but relies on the assumption of a constant dust-to-gas ratio. We note that, using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer 12 μm map sensitive to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), an indirect dust tracer, we detect the diffuse extragalactic PAH background up to z ∼ 2. Finally, we provide a procedure to minimize the level of biased magnitude corrections in maps with extragalactic imprints.},

	abstract = {The widely used Milky Way dust reddening map, the Schlegel, Finkbeiner, \& Davis (1998, SFD) map, was found to contain extragalactic large-scale structure (LSS) imprints (Chiang \& M{\textbackslash}'enard 2019). Such contamination is inherent in maps based on infrared emission, which pick up not only Galactic dust but also the cosmic infrared background (CIB). When SFD is used for extinction correction, over-correction occurs in a spatially correlated and redshift-dependent manner, which could impact precision cosmology using galaxy clustering, lensing, and supernova Ia distances. Similarly, LSS imprints in other Galactic templates can affect intensity mapping and cosmic microwave background experiments. This paper presents a generic way to remove LSS traces in Galactic maps and applies it to SFD. First, we measure descriptive summary statistics of the CIB in SFD by cross-correlating the map with spectroscopic galaxies and quasars in SDSS tomographically as functions of redshift and angular scale. To reconstruct the LSS on the map level, however, additional information on the phases is needed. We build a large set of 180 overcomplete, full-sky basis template maps from the density fields of over 600 million galaxies in WISE and find a linear combination that reproduces all the high-dimensional tomographic two-point statistics of the CIB in SFD. After subtracting this reconstructed LSS/CIB field, the end product is a full-sky Galactic dust reddening map that supersedes SFD, carrying all Galactic features therein, with maximally suppressed CIB. We release this new dust map dubbed CSFD, the Corrected SFD, at https://idv.sinica.edu.tw/ykchiang/CSFD.html and NASA's LAMBDA archive.},

Observations of large-scale structure (LSS) should show a related "kinematic dipole" and help test the kinematic origin of the CMB dipole. Intriguingly, many previous LSS dipole studies suggest discrepancies with the expectations from the CMB. Here we reassess the apparent inconsistency between the CMB measurements and dipole estimates from the NVSS catalog of radio sources. We find that it is important to account for the shot-noise and clustering of the NVSS sources, as well as kinematic contributions, in determining the expected dipole signal. We use the clustering redshift method and a cross-matching technique to refine estimates of the clustering term. We then derive a probability distribution for the expected NVSS dipole in a standard \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM cosmological model including all (i.e., kinematic, shot-noise and clustering) dipole components. Our model agrees with most of the previous NVSS dipole measurements in the literature at better than \${\textbackslash}lesssim 2{\textbackslash}sigma\$.

	abstract = {A precise interstellar dust extinction law is critically important to interpret observations. There are two indicators of extinction: the color excess ratio (CER) and the relative extinction. Compared to the CER, the wavelength-dependent relative extinction is more challenging to be determined. In this work, we combine spectroscopic, astrometric, and photometric data to derive high-precision CERs and relative extinction from optical to mid-infrared (IR) bands. A group of 61,111 red clump (RC) stars are selected as tracers by stellar parameters from the Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment survey. The multiband photometric data are collected from Gaia, APASS, Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Pan-STARRS1, Two Micron All Sky Survey, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer surveys. For the first time, we calibrate the curvature of CERs in determining CERs E(λ − GRP)/E(GBP − GRP) from color excess–color excess diagrams. Through elaborate uncertainty analysis, we conclude that the precision of our CERs is significantly improved (σ {\textless} 0.015). With parallaxes from Gaia DR2, we calculate the relative extinction / for 5051 RC stars. By combining the CERs with the /, the optical–mid-IR extinction Aλ/ has been determined in a total of 21 bands. Given no bias toward any specific environment, our extinction law represents the average extinction law with the total-to-selective extinction ratio RV = 3.16 ± 0.15. Our observed extinction law supports an adjustment in parameters of the CCM RV = 3.1 curve, together with the near-IR (NIR) power-law index α = 2.07 ± 0.03. The relative extinction values of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIR bandpasses are predicted in 2.5\% precision. As the observed reddening/extinction tracks are curved, the curvature correction needs to be considered when applying extinction correction.},

With this group catalogue we are able to estimate the 2PCFs for systems ranging from isolated galaxies to rich clusters of galaxies. The real-space correlation length obtained for these systems ranges from ∼4 to ∼15 h−1 Mpc, respectively. The observed correlation amplitude (and the corresponding bias factor) as a function of group abundance is well reproduced by associating galaxy groups with dark matter haloes in the standard -cold dark matter model. Redshift distortions are clearly detected in the redshift-space correlation function, the degree of which is consistent with the assumption of gravitational clustering and halo bias in the cosmic density ﬁeld. In agreement with previous studies we ﬁnd a strong increase of the correlation length with the mean intergroup separation. Although well-determined observationally, we show that current theoretical predictions are not yet accurate enough to allow for stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. Finally, we use our results to explore the power-law nature of the 2PCF of galaxies. We split the 2PCF into one- and two-group terms, equivalent to the one- and two-halo terms in halo occupation models, and show that the power-law form of the 2PCF is broken, when only including galaxies in the more massive systems.},

If the cosmological principle is valid, these two dipoles are directly linked, such that the amplitude of one determines that of the other. However, it is a longstanding problem that number counts of radio sources and of quasars at low and intermediate redshifts exhibit a dipole that is well aligned with that of the CMB but with about twice the expected amplitude, leading to a tension reaching up to 4.9σ. In this paper, we revisit the theoretical derivation of the dipole in the sources number counts, explicitly accounting for the redshift evolution of the population of sources. We argue that if the spectral index and magnification bias of the sources vary with redshift, the standard theoretical description of the dipole may be inaccurate. We provide an alternative expression which does not depend on the spectral index, but instead on the time evolution of the population of sources. We then determine the values that this evolution rate should have in order to remove the tension with the CMB dipole.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the High Frequency Instrument (HFI) data processing procedures for the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 2018 release. Major improvements in mapmaking have been achieved since the previous {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} 2015 release, many of which were used and described already in an intermediate paper dedicated to the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} polarized data at low multipoles. These improvements enabled the first significant measurement of the reionization optical depth parameter using {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-HFI data. This paper presents an extensive analysis of systematic effects, including the use of end-to-end simulations to facilitate their removal and characterize the residuals. The polarized data, which presented a number of known problems in the 2015 {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} release, are very significantly improved, especially the leakage from intensity to polarization. Calibration, based on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, is now extremely accurate and in the frequency range 100–353 GHz reduces intensity-to-polarization leakage caused by calibration mismatch. The Solar dipole direction has been determined in the three lowest HFI frequency channels to within one arc minute, and its amplitude has an absolute uncertainty smaller than 0.35 {\textless}i{\textgreater}μ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}K, an accuracy of order 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. This is a major legacy from the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Planck{\textless}i/{\textgreater} HFI for future CMB experiments. The removal of bandpass leakage has been improved for the main high-frequency foregrounds by extracting the bandpass-mismatch coefficients for each detector as part of the mapmaking process; these values in turn improve the intensity maps. This is a major change in the philosophy of “frequency maps”, which are now computed from single detector data, all adjusted to the same average bandpass response for the main foregrounds. End-to-end simulations have been shown to reproduce very well the relative gain calibration of detectors, as well as drifts within a frequency induced by the residuals of the main systematic effect (analogue-to-digital convertor non-linearity residuals). Using these simulations, we have been able to measure and correct the small frequency calibration bias induced by this systematic effect at the 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} level. There is no detectable sign of a residual calibration bias between the first and second acoustic peaks in the CMB channels, at the 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} level.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04925},
	abstract = {The Cosmological Principle is part of the foundation that underpins the standard model of the Universe. In the era of precision cosmology, when stress tests of the standard model are uncovering various tensions and possible anomalies, it is critical to check the viability of this Principle. A key test is the consistency between the kinematic dipoles of the cosmic microwave background and of the large-scale matter distribution. Results using radio continuum and quasar samples indicate a rough agreement in the directions of the two dipoles, but a larger than expected amplitude of the matter dipole. The resulting tension with the radiation dipole has been estimated at \${\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}sigma\$ for some cases, suggesting a potential new cosmological tension and a possible violation of the Cosmological Principle. However, the standard formalism for predicting the dipole in the 2-dimensional projection of sources overlooks possible evolution effects in the luminosity function. In fact, radial information from the luminosity function is necessary for a correct projection of the 3-dimensional source distribution. Using a variety of current models of the quasar luminosity function, we show that neglecting redshift evolution can significantly overestimate the relative velocity amplitude. While the models we investigate are consistent with each other and with current data, the dipole derived from these, which depends on derivatives of the luminosity function, can disagree by more than \$3{\textbackslash}sigma\$. This theoretical systematic bias needs to be resolved before robust conclusions can be made about a new cosmic tension.},

	title = {The {Impact} of {Anisotropic} {Redshift} {Distributions} on {Angular} {Clustering}},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15406},
	abstract = {A leading way to constrain physical theories from cosmological observations is to test their predictions for the angular clustering statistics of matter tracers, a technique that is set to become ever more central with the next generation of large imaging surveys. Interpretation of this clustering requires knowledge of the projection kernel, or the redshift distribution of the sources, and the typical assumption is an isotropic redshift distribution for the objects. However, variations in the the kernel are expected across the survey footprint due to photometric variations and residual observational non-idealities. We develop the formalism for anisotropic projection and present several limiting cases that elucidate the key aspects. We quantify the impact of anisotropies in the redshift distribution on a general class of angular two-point statistics. In particular, we identify a mode-coupling effect that can add power to auto-correlations, including galaxy clustering and cosmic shear, and remove it from certain cross-correlations. If the projection anisotropy is primarily at large scales, the mode-coupling depends upon its variance as a function of redshift; furthermore, it is often of similar shape to the signal. In contrast, the cross-correlation of a field whose selection function is anisotropic with another one featuring no such variations -- such as CMB lensing -- is immune to these effects. We discuss explicitly several special cases of the general formalism including galaxy clustering, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cosmic shear and cross-correlations with CMB lensing, and publicly release a code to compute the biases.},

	abstract = {The Cosmological Principle, that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on sufficiently large scales, underpins the standard model of cosmology. However, a recent analysis of 1.36 million infrared-selected quasars has identified a significant tension in the amplitude of the number-count dipole compared to that derived from the CMB, thus challenging the Cosmological Principle. Here we present a Bayesian analysis of the same quasar sample, testing various hypotheses using the Bayesian evidence. We find unambiguous evidence for the presence of a dipole in the distribution of quasars with a direction that is consistent with the dipole identified in the CMB. However, the amplitude of the dipole is found to be 2.7 times larger than that expected from the conventional kinematic explanation of the CMB dipole, with a statistical significance of \$5.7{\textbackslash}sigma\$. To compare these results with theoretical expectations, we sharpen the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM predictions for the probability distribution of the amplitude, taking into account a number of observational and theoretical systematics. In particular, we show that the presence of the galactic plane mask causes a considerable loss of dipole signal due to a leakage of power into higher multipoles, exacerbating the discrepancy in the amplitude. By contrast, we estimate using probabilistic arguments that the source evolution of quasars improves the discrepancy, but only mildly so. These results support the original findings of an anomalously large quasar dipole, independent of the statistical methodology used.},
